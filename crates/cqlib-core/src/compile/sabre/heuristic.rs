//! SABRE trial and SWAP-selection configuration.
//!
//! The router evaluates candidate SWAPs with a weighted distance score:
//!
//! ```text
//! score = decay(swap)
//!       * (basic_weight * front_layer_distance
//!          + sum_i lookahead_weights[i] * lookahead_layer_i_distance)
//! ```
//!
//! Lower scores are preferred. The front layer contains currently executable
//! two-qubit DAG nodes once the layout makes their operands adjacent. Lookahead
//! layers bias the local decision toward interactions that become relevant
//! soon after the current front layer is routed.
//!
//! Decay is optional. When enabled, physical qubits recently used in heuristic
//! SWAPs receive a slightly larger multiplier, discouraging repeated movement
//! around the same area of the device and improving parallelism. The decay
//! table is reset after [`SabreHeuristicConfig::decay_reset`] heuristic SWAPs.
//!
//! [`SabreTrialObjective`] controls how independent routing trials are compared
//! after they produce complete routed circuits. It does not change the local
//! SWAP score; it changes only final trial selection and layout refinement
//! tie-breaking.
