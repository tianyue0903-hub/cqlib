//! Layout scoring objective shared by layout algorithms.
//!
//! A layout objective assigns lower scores to better candidate mappings. The
//! score combines topology distance, directed-coupling mismatch, optional
//! two-qubit error rates, and optional readout error rates. Algorithms may use
//! this objective either as a final ranking function or as a local tie-breaker
//! while constructing a candidate.
