//! Circuit interaction analysis used by layout methods.
//!
//! The analyzer extracts the information that initial-layout algorithms need:
//! logical qubits in circuit order and a deterministic weighted graph of
//! two-qubit interactions. Single-qubit operations, classical data operations,
//! directives, and delays do not constrain layout and are ignored.
//!
//! Structured classical-control operations are scanned recursively. This is a
//! static compiler analysis: a gate in a branch or loop body contributes once
//! to the layout model, regardless of whether that path is taken at runtime.
