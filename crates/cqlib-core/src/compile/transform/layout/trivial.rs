//! Trivial initial layout.

//! This algorithm is the deterministic baseline for the layout stack: logical
//! qubits are assigned to usable physical qubits in their existing order. It is
//! intentionally simple, but it still runs the shared objective and diagnostics
//! so callers can compare it with optimized algorithms.

/// Maps logical qubits to usable physical qubits in their existing order.
///
/// This layout method deliberately does not optimize topology, direction, or
/// calibration data. It is useful as a deterministic baseline and for circuits
/// whose logical order already matches the target device.
///
/// The returned diagnostics report whether the baseline is already perfect for
/// the circuit interaction graph. A non-perfect result is still valid input for
/// a later routing pass.
///
/// # Errors
///
/// Returns [`CompilerError::InvalidInput`] if the circuit has more logical
/// qubits than the device has usable physical qubits, or if scoring rejects the
/// resulting layout.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// use cqlib_core::circuit::{Circuit, Qubit};
/// use cqlib_core::compile::transform::{LayoutObjective, trivial_layout};
/// use cqlib_core::device::{Device, LogicalQubit, PhysicalQubit};
///
/// let mut circuit = Circuit::new(2);
/// circuit.cx(Qubit::new(0), Qubit::new(1)).unwrap();
/// let device = Device::line("line-2", 2).unwrap();
///
/// let result = trivial_layout(&circuit, &device, &LayoutObjective::topology_only()).unwrap();
