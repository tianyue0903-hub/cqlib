//! Knowledge-based local circuit rewrite.
//!
//! This pass consumes validated compiler knowledge rules and applies them as
//! dependency-aware local rewrites. It is a local rewrite engine, not a global
//! optimizer: it searches bounded operation windows, checks rule conditions,
//! applies cost policy, and rebuilds the affected circuit regions.
//!
//! [`RewriteConfig::production`] selects the conservative optimization mode
//! used by normal compiler cleanup. It enables simplification, cancellation,
//! merge, and canonicalization rules and accepts rewrites only under the local
//! cost model. [`RewriteConfig::lowering`] enables decomposition and
//! hardware-native rules as well, allowing local expansion when the caller has
//! requested explicit target-basis lowering.
//!
//! Target-basis translation is expressed by calling
//! [`RewriteConfig::with_target_instructions`]. The rewriter then rejects a
//! lowering result that still contains gate-like instructions outside the
//! configured basis.
//!
//! The pass recurses into supported structured classical-control bodies. It
//! does not synthesize arbitrary matrix-backed unitaries, choose layouts, route
//! through device topology, or perform directed-coupling legalization.
