//! Circuit transforms used by the compiler workflow.
//!
//! This module contains reusable compiler algorithms that transform, analyze,
//! place, or route a [`Circuit`](crate::circuit::Circuit). It is an algorithm
//! boundary rather than a workflow manager: callers may compose individual
//! transforms directly, while the public [`compile`](crate::compile::compile)
//! entry point decides when each completed transform runs in the staged
//! pipeline.
//!
//! # Transform Contract
//!
//! Circuit-to-circuit passes implement [`Transformer`]. A transformer takes an
//! immutable circuit reference and returns a [`TransformResult`] containing a
//! rebuilt circuit and a `changed` flag. The flag reports whether that
//! transform changed the compiler IR representation. Callers should not
//! pre-scan a circuit to infer whether a transform should run; the transform
//! itself owns traversal of any operation forms it supports, including
//! structured classical-control bodies.
//!
//! Layout and routing algorithms expose richer result types because they
//! return placement scores, final layouts, SWAP counts, and routing
//! diagnostics. They are still transform-layer algorithms and do not make
//! workflow policy decisions such as target-basis selection.
//!
//! # Module Roles
//!
//! - [`canonicalize`] validates and normalizes the compiler IR without doing
//!   semantic optimization or hardware lowering.
//! - [`decompose`] expands circuit-backed definitions, synthesizes
//!   matrix-backed unitaries, and lowers multi-controlled gates.
//! - [`rewrite`] applies compiler knowledge rules for conservative
//!   optimization or explicit target-basis lowering.
//! - [`layout`] selects an initial logical-to-physical mapping for a device but
//!   does not insert SWAPs.
//! - [`routing`] rebuilds a physical circuit from an automatic or supplied
//!   initial layout and inserts SWAPs as needed.
//!
//! Direct use of this module is appropriate for tests, diagnostics, and custom
//! pipelines. Most users should start with [`compile`](crate::compile::compile)
//! so target constraints, resources, routing, and output canonicalization stay
//! ordered consistently.
