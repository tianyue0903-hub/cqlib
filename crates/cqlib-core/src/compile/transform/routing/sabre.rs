//! SABRE routing transform.
//!
//! This module adapts the compiler SABRE core into transform-level routing
//! entry points. The algorithm implementation remains in
//! [`crate::compile::sabre`]; this layer owns only the public result types
//! and the high-level `route_sabre` / `route_with_layout` APIs.
//!
//! # Two entry points
//!
//! - [`route_with_layout`] — route with a caller-supplied initial layout.
//!   Returns [`RoutedCircuit`], a pure routing result without layout metadata.
//! - [`route_sabre`] — run SABRE layout refinement then routing in one call.
//!   Returns [`SabreRouteResult`], which wraps a [`RoutedCircuit`] and adds
//!   the layout score.
