//! Multi-controlled Pauli synthesis primitives.
//!
//! This module adapts the exact [`super::mcx`] algorithms to multi-controlled
//! Pauli operations. Callers select an algorithm explicitly and provide the
//! flattened controls and any required ancillary qubits. Resource planning and
//! device inspection belong to the future `mc_gate` decomposition planner.
//!
//! `Y` and `Z` are synthesized by conjugating an exact MCX on the target:
//!
//! ```text
//! MCY = SDG(target); MCX; S(target)
//! MCZ = H(target);   MCX; H(target)
//! ```
//!
//! Relative-phase MCX operations are intentionally not exposed through this
//! layer because they are not exact multi-controlled Pauli operations.
