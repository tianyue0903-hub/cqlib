//! Numeric synthesis for matrix-backed custom unitary gates.
//!
//! This module lowers custom [`UnitaryGate`](crate::circuit::UnitaryGate)
//! operations that have a concrete numeric matrix representation. It is the
//! matrix-synthesis branch of [`decompose`](super), separate from
//! circuit-backed definition expansion and multi-controlled gate lowering.
//!
//! # Supported inputs
//!
//! The circuit-facing pass supports fixed numeric one- and two-qubit unitary
//! matrices. A parameterized matrix is supported only after every argument at
//! the call site resolves to a finite numeric value. Three-qubit and larger
//! matrices are rejected explicitly.
//!
//! This module does not expand circuit-backed definitions, lower ordinary
//! standard gates to a target basis, adapt gates to hardware topology, or
//! allocate ancillas. Run
//! [`expand_definitions`](super::definition::expand_definitions) before matrix
//! synthesis when a circuit may contain unitary gates backed by subcircuits.
//!
//! # Internal layers
//!
//! - [`decompose`] owns the circuit traversal entry point, parameter-table
//!   rebuilding, control-flow handling, and global-phase propagation.
//! - [`unitary_1q`] decomposes a concrete 2x2 matrix into a local `U` gate and a
//!   scalar global phase.
//! - [`unitary_2q`] converts a concrete 4x4 matrix into local `U` gates plus a
//!   selectable two-qubit interaction basis.
//! - [`two_qubit_kak`] owns the circuit-agnostic KAK / Weyl numerical
//!   primitive used by the two-qubit emitter.
