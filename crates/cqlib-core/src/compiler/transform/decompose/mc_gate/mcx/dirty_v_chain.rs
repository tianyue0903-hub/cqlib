//! I15 MCX synthesis using a dirty-ancilla V-chain.
//!
//! This module implements the linear-size construction described by Iten et
//! al., *Quantum Circuits for Isometries*, Phys. Rev. A 93, 032318 (2016),
//! [arXiv:1501.06911](https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06911). For an MCX with `k >=
//! 3` controls, the construction consumes `k - 2` borrowed dirty ancillas.
//! These ancillas may enter in unknown states and may be modified while the
//! circuit runs, but every consumed ancilla is restored exactly before the
//! returned operation sequence completes.
//!
//! Dirty inputs require two V-chain rounds. Each round toggles the target
//! endpoint, propagates control information backward through action gadgets,
//! applies one relative-phase Toffoli at the start of the chain, and restores
//! the internal ancillas with inverse reset gadgets. Repeating the ladder
//! removes the dependence on the unknown initial ancilla values.
//!
//! The module provides an exact MCX entry point and a relative-phase variant.
//! The latter has the same computational-basis bit-flip behavior and the same
//! ancilla-restoration guarantee, but it may add basis-state-dependent phases.
//! It is intended only for surrounding constructions, such as B95 recursion,
//! that prove those phases cancel. Ancilla allocation, algorithm selection,
//! open-control normalization, and later `CCX` basis lowering remain the
//! responsibility of higher compiler layers.
