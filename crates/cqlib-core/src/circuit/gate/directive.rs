//! Non-Unitary Circuit Directives
//!
//! This module defines [`Directive`], an enum representing non-unitary operations
//! that can appear in quantum circuits. Unlike unitary gates, these operations
//! are generally irreversible and represent interactions with the classical world
//! (measurement) or hardware-level instructions (barriers, resets).

use std::fmt;

/// Non-unitary operations in a quantum circuit.
///
/// Directives represent operations that cannot be described by unitary matrices
/// and often involve classical outcomes or hardware-specific behavior.
///
/// # Variants
///
/// - `Barrier`: Prevents gate reordering across its boundary during optimization
/// - `Measure`: Collapses qubit state to classical bit
/// - `Reset`: Prepares qubit in |0⟩ state
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use cqlib_core::circuit::gate::Directive;
///
/// // Create a barrier directive
/// let barrier = Directive::Barrier;
///
/// // Measurement directive
/// let measure = Directive::Measure;
///
/// // Reset directive
/// let reset = Directive::Reset;
/// ```
