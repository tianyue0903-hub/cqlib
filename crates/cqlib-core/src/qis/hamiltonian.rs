//! Hamiltonian representation and operations.

//! This module provides the [`Hamiltonian`] struct, which represents a quantum
//! observable as a linear combination of Pauli strings (tensor products of Pauli operators)
//! with complex coefficients. It is primarily used for defining system energies,
//! observables for expectation value calculations, and operators for time evolution.
