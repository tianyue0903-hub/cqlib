    Measurement outcome as a compact bitstring.

    Represents a quantum measurement result as a bit vector. The outcome

    numbers of qubits.

    # Bit Ordering

    Uses little-endian bit ordering: the rightmost bit in the string
    corresponds to qubit 0, and the leftmost to qubit N-1.

    # Example

    ```python
    from cqlib.device import Outcome

    # Create from bitstring
    outcome = Outcome("101")  # Qubit 0 = 1, Qubit 1 = 0, Qubit 2 = 1

    # Check individual bits
    assert outcome.is_one(0)  # True
    assert not outcome.is_one(1)  # False

    # Convert back to string
    bitstring = outcome.to_bitstring(3)  # "101"
