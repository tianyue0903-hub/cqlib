class Topology:
    """A directed coupling graph representing quantum hardware connectivity.

    Each node represents a physical qubit, and each directed edge
    represents a coupling between qubits (e.g., for two-qubit gates
    like CNOT).

    **Directed**: A coupling ``a → b`` does **not** imply ``b → a``.
    This accurately models hardware where gates only work in specific
    control-target directions.

    Key Usage — construction::

        >>> from cqlib.device import Topology
        >>>
        >>> # Directed couplings: 0 → 1, 1 → 2, 2 → 3
        >>> topo = Topology([0, 1, 2, 3], [(0, 1, "CX"), (1, 2, "CX"), (2, 3, "CX")])
        >>>
        >>> topo.num_qubits     # 4
        >>> topo.num_couplings  # 3

    Key Usage — line factory::

        >>> topo = Topology.line([0, 1, 2, 3])
        >>> # Creates: 0 → 1, 1 → 2, 2 → 3

    Key Usage — query connectivity::

        >>> topo.supports_directed_coupling(0, 1)          # True
        >>> topo.supports_directed_coupling(1, 0)          # False
        >>> topo.supports_coupling_either_direction(0, 1)  # True (1→0 may exist separately)
        >>>
        >>> topo.successors(1)        # [Qubit(2)]  — outgoing
        >>> topo.predecessors(1)      # [Qubit(0)]  — incoming
        >>> topo.neighbors_undirected(1)  # [Qubit(0), Qubit(2)]
        >>>
        >>> topo.out_degree(0)  # 1
        >>> topo.in_degree(2)   # 1

    Key Usage — mutation::

        >>> topo.add_qubits([4])
        >>> topo.add_couplings([(3, 4, "CX")])
        >>> topo.remove_couplings([(0, 1)])
        >>> topo.remove_qubits([3])
