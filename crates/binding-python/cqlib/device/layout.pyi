class Layout:
    """Maps circuit logical qubits to physical qubits on a quantum device.

    A layout owns the set of physical qubits available to a placement or
    routing step. Every logical qubit present in the layout has exactly one
    physical mapping. A physical qubit may be **vacant** (not carrying a
    logical qubit).

    Layout does **not** allocate auxiliary qubits. Auxiliary qubits are
    logical circuit resources and must be managed by the compiler resource
    manager before they are :meth:`bind` to physical qubits.

    Key Usage — basic mapping::

        >>> from cqlib.device import Layout
        >>>
        >>> # 2 logical qubits on 4 physical qubits
        >>> layout = Layout([0, 1], [100, 101, 102, 103])
        >>>
        >>> layout.num_logical          # 2
        >>> layout.num_vacant_physical  # 2
        >>> layout.num_physical         # 4
        >>>
        >>> layout.get_physical(0)  # Qubit(100) or similar
        >>> layout.get_logical(100) # Qubit(0) or similar

    Key Usage — custom initial mapping::

        >>> init_map = {0: 101, 1: 100}
        >>> layout = Layout([0, 1], [100, 101, 102], init_map=init_map)
        >>>
        >>> layout.get_physical(0)  # Qubit(101)

    Key Usage — from pairs::

        >>> layout = Layout.from_pairs([(0, 2), (1, 0)], physical_count=4)
        >>> # Logical 0 → Physical 2, Logical 1 → Physical 0
        >>> # Physical 1, 3 are vacant

    Key Usage — bind/unbind during routing::

        >>> # Bind a new logical qubit to a vacant physical qubit
        >>> layout.bind(2, 102)
        >>>
        >>> # Release a logical qubit
        >>> freed = layout.unbind(2)  # returns the released physical qubit
