"""Runtime classical types and circuit-local handles.

These types model the classical side of dynamic circuits: typed storage
locations (:class:`ClassicalVar`), immutable measurement results
(:class:`ClassicalValue`), and measurement receipts
(:class:`Measurement`).  Each handle is tied to a :class:`CircuitId` that
prevents accidental mixing of handles from different circuits.
