"""Non-unitary circuit directives.

Directives represent operations that carry instructions to the
backend or compiler but do not have a unitary matrix representation.
They are classified into three categories:

- **Barrier**: Prevents gate reordering across the listed qubits during
  optimisation passes.  Useful for timing-sensitive sequences or when
  the backend must respect a particular gate order for hardware reasons.
- **Measure**: Indicates a mid-circuit projective measurement in the
  computational basis.  On hardware this collapses the qubit; in
  simulation it projects the state vector.
- **Reset**: Forces a qubit into the :math:`|0\\rangle` state regardless
  of its current state, discarding coherence.

Directives are typically created via the static factories on the
:class:`Directive` class.  They are added to a circuit through the
generic :meth:`Circuit.append_gate <cqlib.circuit.Circuit.append_gate>`
method or the convenience helpers (e.g. :meth:`Circuit.barrier
<cqlib.circuit.Circuit.barrier>`, :meth:`Circuit.measure
<cqlib.circuit.Circuit.measure>`).

Example::

    from cqlib.circuit.gates import Directive

    barrier = Directive.barrier()
    measure = Directive.measure()
    reset = Directive.reset()
