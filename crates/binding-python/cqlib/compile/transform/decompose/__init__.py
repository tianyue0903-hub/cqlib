"""Circuit decomposition transforms and their configurations.

Use these entry points to lower high-level operations before routing or final
target-basis translation. Configuration objects make resource permissions and
chosen decomposition bases explicit at the call site.

Example::

    from cqlib.circuit import Circuit
    from cqlib.compile.transform.decompose import expand_definitions

    circuit = Circuit(1)
    circuit.h(0)

    result = expand_definitions(circuit)
    assert result.circuit is not circuit
