"""Conservative commutation proofs for compiler transformations.

Successful queries return a :class:`Commutation` proof. ``None`` means only
that the available proof sources could not establish a safe exchange.

Example::

    from cqlib.circuit import Qubit, StandardGate, ValueOperation
    from cqlib.compile.commutation import check_commutation

    lhs = ValueOperation.from_standard_gate(StandardGate.X, [Qubit(0)])
    rhs = ValueOperation.from_standard_gate(StandardGate.Z, [Qubit(0)])

    proof = check_commutation(lhs, rhs)
    if proof is not None:
        print(proof.is_exact(), proof.phase)
