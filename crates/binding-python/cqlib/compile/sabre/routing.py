"""Public bridge to the native SABRE routing implementation.

SABRE inserts SWAP operations so that every two-qubit interaction is executed
on connected physical qubits. The caller supplies the initial logical-to-
physical mapping; the result reports both the normalized initial mapping and
the final mapping after all inserted SWAPs.

Example::

    from cqlib.circuit import Circuit
    from cqlib.compile.sabre import SabreConfig, sabre_route
    from cqlib.device import Device, Layout

    circuit = Circuit(2)
    circuit.cx(0, 1)
    device = Device.line("line3", 3)
    layout = Layout.from_pairs([(0, 0), (1, 2)], physical_count=3)

    result = sabre_route(
        circuit,
        device,
        layout,
        SabreConfig(routing_trials=1, seed=7),
    )
    assert result.swap_count == 1
    print(result.final_layout)
    print(result.diagnostics.two_qubit_depth)
