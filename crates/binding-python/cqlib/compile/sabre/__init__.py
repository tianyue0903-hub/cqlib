"""SWAP-based SABRE routing for connectivity-constrained quantum devices.

Use :func:`sabre_route` when an initial logical-to-physical layout is already
known and the circuit must be made executable on a device topology. A fixed
seed makes cqlib's tie-breaking and multi-trial selection reproducible.

Example::

    from cqlib.circuit import Circuit
    from cqlib.compile.sabre import SabreConfig, sabre_route
    from cqlib.device import Device, Layout

    circuit = Circuit(2)
    circuit.cx(0, 1)
    result = sabre_route(
        circuit,
        Device.line("line3", 3),
        Layout.from_pairs([(0, 0), (1, 2)], physical_count=3),
        SabreConfig(routing_trials=1, seed=7),
    )
    assert result.swap_count == 1
