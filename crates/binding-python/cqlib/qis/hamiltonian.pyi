class Hamiltonian:
    """A quantum Hamiltonian represented as a sum of Pauli strings.

    A `Hamiltonian` is essentially a sparse representation of a $2^N \times 2^N$
    matrix, expressed as $H = \sum_k c_k P_k$, where $c_k$ is a complex coefficient
    and $P_k$ is an $N$-qubit Pauli string.

    This is commonly used for defining system energies, observables for expectation
    value calculations, and operators for time evolution.

    Examples:
        >>> from cqlib.qis import Hamiltonian, PauliString
        >>> # Create a 2-qubit Hamiltonian
        >>> h = Hamiltonian(2)
        >>> # Add terms: H = 0.5 * ZZ + 0.3 * XX
        >>> h.add_term(PauliString.from_str("ZZ"), 0.5)
        >>> h.add_term(PauliString.from_str("XX"), 0.3)
        >>> # Simplify to merge duplicate terms
        >>> h.simplify()
